### Building from Source

This repository uses Maven to generate the output documentation. Command line users can generate the complete output from this 
    repository by using the following command:

    mvn clean generate-sources

The output appears in PDF and HTML form in the following locations. The items in the **Name** column link to the location 
    where the documentation is published, when available.

| Name | Build Location |
| --- | --- |
| [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.rackspace.com/images/api/v2/ci-gettingstarted) | target/docbkx/webhelp/ci-getting-started-external |
| [Developer Guide](http://docs.rackspace.com/images/api/v2/ci-devguide/) | target/docbkx/webhelp/ci-devguide-external |

#### Editors

You can use any text editor to work with these source files. If you want to use an IDE, consider [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org). 
    This cross-platform IDE offers seamless support for Maven projects and does not require  additional configuration to open
    the **pom.xml** file as a project. You can configure the project so that the **Build** command, which appears when you 
    right-click a project in the **Projects** pane, executes the `clean generate-sources` command. To do so, perform the following 
    steps:

1. Right-click the project in the **Projects** pane and select **Properties**.
2. Select the **Build** category in the left pane, and then select the **Build project** action in the right pane.
3. Change **Execute Goals** to `clean generate-sources`.
4. *(Optional)* Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the **Clean and Build project** and **Build with Dependencies** actions.
