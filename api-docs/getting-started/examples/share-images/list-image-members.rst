Listing image members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to see everyone with whom you've shared an image and the status of
each member, list the image members.

-  Issue the following cURL command to list the image members for an
   image. In this example, you list members for image
   ``a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6``.

**cURL list image members request**

   .. code::

       curl -s API_ENDPOINT/v2/images/a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6/members \
       -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" |python -m json.tool


   **Options:**

   -  **-s**: Runs the command in silent mode.

   -  **-H**: Specified header information. In this case, it provides the
      authentication token. If you previously exported the token environment
      variable as instructed in
      :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>`, you
      can use the $AUTH_TOKEN variable. Otherwise, substitute your actual token
      for the variable.

   -  **-m json.tool**: Specifies json.tool, which pretty-prints the
      JSON output.

   **List image members with cURL response**

   .. code::

       {
           "members": [
               {
                   "created_at": "2013-10-07T17:58:03Z",
