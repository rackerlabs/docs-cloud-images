Updating an image member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you send a request, outside of the Cloud Images API, to an image producer
asking for access to an image, the image producer creates an image member with
your tenant ID by using the instructions in :ref:`Create an image member
<sharing-image-create-image-member>`. Once the image member has been created
for you, you update the image member, either accepting the image (which adds it
to your image list), or rejecting the image (which notifies the producer that
you received the image share notification and don't want it in your image
list).

.. tip::

   For more information about image member statuses, see
   :ref:`Image member statuses<member-statuses>`.

Issue the following cURL command to update an image member for an image. In
this example, you (member ID ``123456``) accept the offer of the shared image
``a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6``.

**cURL update an image member request**

.. code::

   curl -s $API_ENDPOINT/v2/images/a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6/members/123456 \
   -X PUT -d '{"status":"accepted"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"|python -m json.tool

**Options:**

-  **-X**: Identifies the HTTP command. If no ``-X`` parameter is specified,
   the default is **GET**.

-  **-s**: Runs the command in silent mode.

-  **-H**: Specified header information. In this case, it provides the
   content-type and the authentication token. If you previously exported the
   token environment variable as instructed in
   :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>`,
   you can use the $AUTH_TOKEN variable. Otherwise, substitute your actual
   token for the variable.

-  **-d**: Specifies the JSON request body.

-  **-m json.tool**: Specifies json.tool, which pretty-prints the JSON output.

**Update an image member with cURL response**
