Deleting an image member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you decide to no longer share your image with a user, delete that image
member.

Issue the following cURL command to delete an image member for an image. In
this example, you delete the user ``123456`` so that the user can no longer
share the image ``a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6``.


**cURL delete an image member request**

.. code::

   curl -i $API_ENDPOINT/v2/images/a96be11e-8536-4910-92cb-de50aa19dfe6/members/123456 \
   -X DELETE \
   -H "X-Auth-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN"


**Options:**

-  **-X**: Identifies the HTTP command. If no ``-X`` parameter is specified,
   the default is **GET**.

-  **-i**: Includes headers in the output so you can see the result of the
   request.

-  **-H**: Specified header information. In this case, it provides the
   authentication token. If you previously exported the token environment
   variable as instructed in
   :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>`, you can
   use the $AUTH_TOKEN variable. Otherwise, substitute your actual token for
   the variable.

   If the operation is successful, it returns an ``HTTP 204`` response code
   with no response body.
