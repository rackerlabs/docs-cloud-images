Use images
------------

The Cloud Images service provides basic operations for managing images, such as
listing and updating images. You can also use tasks to import images to and
export images from your Cloud Files account. To learn more about the
fundamentals of image tasks, see
:ref:`Asynchronous tasks <asynchronous-tasks>`.

To help you get started exploring Cloud Images, the following sections show
some basic image operations with cURL examples.

Before running the examples, review the :ref:`Cloud Images concepts<concepts>`.

.. note::
     These examples use the ``$API_ENDPOINT`` and ``$AUTH_TOKEN`` environment
     variables to specify the API endpoint and authentication token values
     for accessing the service. Make sure you
     :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>` before
     running the code samples.
