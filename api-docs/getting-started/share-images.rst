Share images
--------------

The Cloud Images API enables image owners to share images that they have
created with others and to use images created by someone else. See
:ref:`Image sharing <image-sharing>` to learn more about the fundamental
concepts.

The following sections show some basic image sharing operations with cURL
examples.

.. note::

    The user with whom the image is being shared in these examples is
    identified by a ``member_id``, which is the same as that user's tenant_id.

To help you get started exploring Cloud Images, the following sections show
some basic image operations with cURL examples.

Before running the examples, review the :ref:`Cloud Images concepts<concepts>`.

.. note::
    These examples use the ``$API_ENDPOINT`` and ``$AUTH_TOKEN`` environment
    variables to specify the API endpoint and authentication token values
    for accessing the service. Make sure you
    :ref:`configure these variables<configure-environment-variables>` before
    running the code samples.
