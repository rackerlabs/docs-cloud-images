Rackspace |product name| API |contract version|
===============================================

*Last updated:* |today|

The |apiservice| service enables developers to create and manipulate images,
image members, and associated metadata through a simple Representational State
Transfer (REST) web service interface.

The |product name| service is closely aligned with the Rackspace Cloud Servers
service and Cloud Files service. Images are captured from, and applied to,
cloud servers and are stored on, and retrieved from, Cloud Files storage.

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the REST application programming interface (API) for the
|service| service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding
of the :how-to:`Rackspace Cloud Images service <cloud-images-faq>`
and have a :rax-cart:`Rackspace Cloud account <cloud>` with access to the
|product name| service. You should also be familiar with the following
technologies:

-  *RESTful* web services
-  *HTTP*/1.1
-  JSON data serialization format
