    <para>The Rackspace Cloud Images service is a regionalized service. The user of the service is therefore responsible for
        selecting the appropriate regional endpoint to ensure access to servers, networks, or other Cloud services.</para>
    <tip>
        <para> To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, read about special considerations for choosing a data
            center at

        </para>
    </tip>
    <para>If you are working with cloud services that are in one of the Rackspace data centers, using the ServiceNet endpoint
        in the same data center has no network costs and provides a faster connection. ServiceNet is the data center internet
        network. In your authentication response service catalog, it is listed as InternalURL. If you are working with
        services that are not in one of the Rackspace data centers, you must use a public endpoint to connect. In your
        authentication response, public endpoints are listed as publicURL. If you are working with services in multiple data
        centers or have a mixed environment where you have services both in your data centers and in Rackspace data centers,
        use a public endpoint because it is accessible from all the servers in the different environments. </para>
    <note>
        <para> You should copy the base URLs directly from the catalog rather than trying to construct them manually.</para>
        <para>Rackspace Cloud Identity returns a service catalog, which includes regional endpoints with your account ID.
            Your account ID, also known as project ID or tenant ID, refers to your Rackspace account number.</para>
    </note>
    <tip>
        <para>If you do not know your account ID or which data center you are working in, you can find that information in
            your Cloud Control Panel at <link xlink:href="http://mycloud.rackspace.com">mycloud.rackspace.com.</link>
