General API Information
=======================

This chapter contains helpful information for using API operations, authenticating, 
and using service endpoints.

The Cloud Images API is defined as a RESTful HTTP service that uses all aspects of the 
HTTP protocol, including methods, URIs, media types, and response codes. To request 
Cloud Images services, you must first issue an authentication request to the Rackspace 
Cloud Identity Service.

The Cloud Images API supports JSON data serialization request and response formats.
