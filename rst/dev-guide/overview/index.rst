About the Rackspace Cloud Images API
-----------------------------------------

The Rackspace Cloud Images API service enables developers to create and manipulate images, 
image members, and associated metadata through a simple Representational State Transfer 
(REST) web service interface.

The Cloud Images service is closely aligned with the Rackspace Cloud Servers service and
Cloud Files service. Images are captured from, and applied to, cloud servers and are
stored on, and retrieved from, Cloud Files storage.
