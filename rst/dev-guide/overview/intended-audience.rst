This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop applications by
using the Rackspace Cloud Images service REST application programming interface (API).
It fully documents the Cloud Images API, which enables developers to interact with the
storage components of the service.

The Cloud Images service is closely aligned with the Rackspace Cloud Servers service and
Cloud Files service. Images are captured from, and applied to, cloud servers and are
stored on, and retrieved from, Cloud Files storage.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding of the
Cloud Images service and have access to an installation of the Cloud Images service. You
should also be familiar with the following technologies:

-  *RESTful* web services
